# VikishopToxicComments

Machine learning for texts 

The Wikishop online store is launching a new service. Now users can edit and add product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, clients propose their own edits and comment on the changes of others. The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and send them for moderation.
Train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. At your disposal is a set of data with markings about the toxicity of edits.
Build a model with an F1 quality metric value of at least 0.75.
